# KirbosAdventure
Redesign of some enemies featured in the classic NES game 'Kirby's Adventure'.
Developed in Unity using original sprites from the game.
The following enemies were redesign:
## Togezo
Patrols if it does not see Kirbo. It detects steps and goes investigating, if it detects other enemies it keeps patroling, if it detects Kirbo it dashes in attack becoming invulnerable.
## Bronto
Flies when out of combat, patroling. If it sees Kirbo on the ground it charges.
## Scarfy
## Simirror
## Coner
## Kracko
